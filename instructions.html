            <h2>Objective</h2>
            <p>The goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over 21.</p>
            
            <h2>Card Values</h2>
            <p>Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value.</p>
            <p>Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are each worth 10 points.</p>
            <p>Ace can be worth 1 or 11 points, whichever is better for the player.</p>
            <p>Joker card: If you receive a Joker, you automatically win the round.</p>
            
            <h2>Game Play</h2>
            <p>Each player, including the dealer, is dealt two cards.</p>
            <p>Players can either "hit" (take another card) or "stand" (keep their current total).</p>
            <p>The dealer must hit until their cards total 17 or higher.</p>
            <p>If a player's total exceeds 21, they "bust" and lose the game.</p>
            <p>If a player's total is higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21, they win.</p>
            
            <h2>Winning</h2>
            <p>A blackjack (Ace + 10-point card) wins automatically.</p>
            <p>If both the player and dealer have the same total, it's a "push" (tie).</p>
            <p>If a player receives a Joker card, they automatically win the round.</p>
            
            <p>Enjoy playing Jokerjack!</p>
